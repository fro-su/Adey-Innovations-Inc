# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

## Project Summary

This project aims to improve the detection of fraud cases in e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions using advanced machine learning models. By leveraging detailed data analysis, feature engineering, and geolocation analysis, we aim to create robust fraud detection models that can be deployed for real-time monitoring and reporting. This initiative will enhance transaction security, prevent financial losses, and build trust with customers and financial institutions.

## Overview

Adey Innovations Inc., a leading company in the financial technology sector, is committed to providing cutting-edge solutions for e-commerce and banking. This project focuses on developing and deploying machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities in transaction data. The models will be trained on two datasets: one containing e-commerce transactions and another containing bank credit transactions. The project also involves deploying these models using Flask and Docker to enable real-time fraud detection.

## Introduction

Fraud detection is critical for ensuring the security and integrity of financial transactions. E-commerce and banking sectors are particularly vulnerable to fraudulent activities, which can lead to significant financial losses and damage to customer trust. By developing sophisticated fraud detection systems, Adey Innovations Inc. aims to enhance the security of transactions and provide reliable protection against fraud.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Analyze and preprocess transaction data to prepare it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and engineer features that help in identifying fraud patterns.
- **Model Building and Training**: Build and train various machine learning models to detect fraud.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models and make necessary improvements.
- **Model Explainability**: Use SHAP and LIME to interpret and explain the models' predictions.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the models for real-time fraud detection using Flask and Docker.
- **API Development**: Create REST APIs to serve the models and enable real-time prediction serving.
